> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We've **depreacted** [Strapi CMS](https://strapi.io/) in favour of [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) because Strapi was costly as it required a live postgres instance always up. Earlier, we used free Heroku to host CMS and later had to move to paid plan of Railway. Decap CMS is integrated in [scriptified/scriptified.dev](https://github.com/scriptified/scriptified.dev) repository itself.
